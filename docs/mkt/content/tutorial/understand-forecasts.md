During this tutorial, you will learn how to read the forecasts generated by PaceMaker. You will learn what a forecast is in software delivery, how they are presented to you and how you can modify your inputs to quickly change those forecasts.

## A bit of theory

When it comes to predicting the future, we are the first at realizing how hard it is. If it was that easy, we would have put our chips in the stock market and be on a beach right now. Unfortunately, our customers don't always see it that way. They have deadlines, budgets and want to know if you can complete their requirements.

So we've decided to say a forecast is a combination of two things: A value (ex: date, money, items) + a probability. For example, when you look at the weather forecast, it's usually a combination of an event + a probability of happening. In the following screenshot from AccuWeather, there's a 25% chance of precipitation.

Predicting the weather for tomorrow isn't an exact science. There are so many variables to take into account. While not as complex as the weather, we've come to believe that software delivery is also complex and that using probabilities within a forecast was a better way to have a conversation with our customer.

## Reading software delivery forecasts

We've created our forecasts the same way as the AccuWeather forecast, plus a color code to simplify it even more. Here's an example to illustrate what we mean:

![Compare forecasts](/img/tutorials/forecast-compare.png)

The weather forecast on the left says we have a 25% chance of some kind of precipitation. As for the software delivery forecast on the right, it says we have a 90% chance of delivering 39 items.

As a weather report can have different types of forecasts (Ex: 14-days forecast, overnight), we've build two types of forecasts for software delivery in PaceMaker. The first one is answer the question **When will it be delivered?** while the second one is **"How many items will I have on a given date?"**  

## When will it be delivered?

This question is answered in the section that starts with a date in the forecast section of PaceMaker.

In the picture above, you can see the delivery date being set to Tuesday, April 4th 2017. Our customer might have business priorities forcing her to have her software ready for that date. On that date, PaceMaker  forecasts that 39 items will be delivered with a confidence of 90%. The green bar (and number) is a visual cue to quickly see which forecasts are good and which one isn't.  

PaceMaker creates 5 forecasts for a given delivery date. In the following picture, we show the 5 forecasts when the delivery date is set to April 4th, 2017.

In this picture, PaceMaker is 90% confident that our customer will have 39 items delivered for April 4th while it is only 30% confidence to deliver 63 items. You can also play with the slider to change the delivery date if the customer is flexible.

## How many items will I have?

In other situations, your team might be forced to delivery a fixed set of features to a customer. For example, your team has 38 items left in its backlog to finish a project. PaceMaker will forecast potential delivery dates in the section that start with a number of items in the forecast section.

![Dates forecast](/img/tutorials/forecast-dates.png)

In the picture above, PaceMaker is 90% confident that your team can deliver those 38 items in the next 25 days. Meanwhile, it is only 30% of delivering those same 38 items in only 16 days.
